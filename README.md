Yes, if you're using **Dream Machine**, anything you create will now use the **Ray2** model as it has replaced the earlier Ray1 model. This means:

- All videos you generate will benefit from **Ray2's advanced features**, including higher realism, smoother motion, and improved physics understanding.
- The outputs will automatically reflect the enhancements Ray2 brings, such as **better visual consistency** and **fewer artifacts**, without requiring any additional setup on your part.
- Depending on your subscription level, you may also gain access to upcoming features like **image-to-video**, **video-to-video**, and **video editing tools**, which will also leverage Ray2.

In short, all content created through Dream Machine will now utilize Ray2 unless otherwise specified by the platform.
